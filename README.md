<h1>Hey there, it's Arian!</h1>
<br>
<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>Feel free to explore my profile. I'm lazy enough not to be able to write & regularly update my profile readme (I really despise the things that frequently change & you must remember to regularly maintain & be mindful of), sorry! My coding repositories should give a clear view, though, of my skill set (or the lack thereof). I'm available on LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef, LeetCode, Kaggle & other usual communities you'll find CS enthusiasts gathering. Very likely, my username is MubtasimSajid, so you should be able to locate me quite easily (although I'm pretty unimportant, so if you do look me up for whatever reason, I'll feel good; thanks). Also, my full name is rather unique, so finding me online shouldn't be a chore.</p>
<br>
<h2>I really like to code (though I'm bad at it🥲)</h2>
<p>I love the idea of computers & humans being able to program with an eloquent tapestry of logic & math. For the CPU, the truth is objective & straightforward. This concept & this ability appear attractive to my curiosity & a thirst for reliable systems. My hope is to contribute to this incredible field & help strengthen the position of the Muslim ummah in the global technological landscape. May Allah help the ummah & bless me.</p>

<p> A lot has been said. Cheers! I wish you luck, O unknown reader. May both of our futures be enlightened. You shall have me at hello, goodbye & everything in between.</p>
