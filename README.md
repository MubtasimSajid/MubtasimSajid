<h1>Hey there, it's Arian</h1>
<p>I belong from the northern city of Naogaon in Bangladesh. I'm currently pursuing BSc in Computer Science & Engineering from Islamic University of Technology. My hope is to contribute to the amazing field of computing & help strengthen the position of the Muslim ummah in the global technological landscape. May Allah help the ummah & bless me to contribute to its ascent.</p>
