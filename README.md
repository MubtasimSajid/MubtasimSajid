<h1>Hey there, it's Arian</h1>
<p>I belong from the northern city of Naogaon in Bangladesh. I'm currently pusuing BSc in Computer Science & Engineering from Islamic University of Technology. My hope is to contribute to the amazing field of computing & help strengthen the position of the Muslim ummah in the global technological landscape. May Allah help the ummah & bless me to contribute to its ascent.</p>

<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>Feel free to explore my profile. I'm lazy enough not to be able to write & regularly update my profile README (I really despise the things that frequently change & you must remember to update it manually & regularly), sorry! My coding repositories should give a clear view, though, of my skill set (or the lack thereof). I'm available on StackOverflow, Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef, LeetCode, Kaggle & other usual communities you'll find CS enthusiasts gathering. Very likely, my username is `MubtasimSajid`, so you should be able to locate me quite easily (although I'm pretty unimportant, so if you do look me up for whatever reason, I'll feel good; thanks). Also, my full name is rather unique, so finding me online shouldn't be a chore.</p>
